<h2>What Is This Project?</h2> <p> Imagine a giant, digital canvas where anyone can help create a massive, collaborative artwork—one pixel at a time! This project is exactly that: a decentralized pixel board where thousands of users collectively “paint” a board made up of 68,000 tiny cells. And the best part? Everything is powered by blockchain technology, making it completely transparent and tamper-proof. </p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2> <p> There are four separate boards (numbered <strong>0</strong> through <strong>3</strong>), and each board is a grid of 170 columns by 100 rows. Every single cell on these boards can be updated by anyone. Here’s a quick breakdown: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Smart Contract:</strong> A special program running on the blockchain keeps track of every pixel. It records who owns each pixel, its color, and how many times it has been updated. </li> <li> <strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> The first time you update a pixel, it costs about <code>0.000022 ETH</code>. Every subsequent update to that pixel becomes 15% more expensive. And if you send a little extra ETH, the surplus is automatically refunded! </li> <li> <strong>User Activity:</strong> Each update is recorded so you can see how many pixels you’ve added or changed. This information is used to recognize the most active contributors. </li> </ul>

<h2>How to Interact with the Project</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Copy &amp; Paste Cell Data:</strong> When you click on a cell on the website, a pop-up displays its details in a simple format: <br /><code>["0","1","52","black"]</code> <br />This means board <strong>0</strong>, X coordinate <strong>1</strong>, Y coordinate <strong>52</strong>, and the cell’s color is <strong>black</strong>. You can copy this data for your own records or to use when updating pixels via other interfaces. </li> <li> <strong>Update Multiple Pixels:</strong> The webpage provides an input field—for example, via a constructor on OKComputers pages—where you can paste a list of cell data in the above format to update many pixels at once using the <code>updatePixels</code> function. </li> <li> <strong>Via Etherscan:</strong> You can also interact directly with the smart contract through Etherscan’s “Write Contract” feature. This allows you to update pixels and verify every transaction on the blockchain. </li> <li> <strong>Decentralized Webpage:</strong> The pixel board is displayed on a webpage stored directly on the blockchain (using OKComputers NFTs). This means the webpage is fully decentralized and cannot be taken down by any single entity. </li> </ul>

<h2>Community Rewards &amp; Event Details</h2> <p> The project is all about community! In addition to creating art, you have a chance to earn exciting rewards: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Prizes:</strong> There will be prizes for the top communities as well as the most active individual contributors. The system measures activity based on the total number of pixels placed and those still visible on the board. </li> <li> <strong>Event Duration:</strong> The event runs for 7 days. At the end of this period, each of the four boards will be minted as an NFT. Two NFTs will be awarded to the most active communities (which they can keep or give away), and two will go to the top individual contributors. </li> </ul>

<h2>Financial Fairness &amp; Maintenance</h2> <p> When you update a pixel, you pay a small fee in ETH. This fee increases each time the pixel is updated, but any excess ETH you send is automatically refunded. The collected ETH helps cover the maintenance cost of the project. Approximately 40% of any surplus funds will be directed to <strong>dailofrog</strong>—the developer behind OKComputers—as a thank-you for maintaining and improving the system. </p>

<h2>In Summary</h2> <p> This project blends digital art and blockchain technology to create a decentralized, community-driven pixel board. Every pixel update is stored on the blockchain for complete transparency and fairness. You can interact with the project via a smart contract on Etherscan or through a decentralized webpage powered by OKComputers NFTs. Whether you’re simply enjoying the art, contributing by updating pixels, or competing for rewards, you’re a vital part of this global, collaborative art movement. </p>
