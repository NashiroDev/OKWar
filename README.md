<h2>What Is This Project?</h2> <p> Imagine a giant, digital canvas where anyone can help create a massive, collaborative artwork—one pixel at a time, or fight over a share of this canva! This project is exactly that: a decentralized pixel board where thousands of users collectively “paint” a board made up of 68,000 tiny cells, divided into four 170*100 boards. And the best part? Everything is ONCHAIN and open source, making it completely transparent and tamper-proof. </p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2> <p> There are four separate boards (numbered <strong>0</strong> through <strong>3</strong>), and each board is a grid of 170 columns by 100 rows. Every single cell on these boards can be updated by anyone. Here’s a quick breakdown: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Smart Contract:</strong> A pixelBoard contract on base that keeps track of every pixel. It records who owns each pixel, its color, and how many times it has been updated. </li> <li> <strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> The first time you update a pixel, it costs about <code>0.000022 ETH</code>. Every subsequent update to that pixel becomes 15% more expensive. And if you send a little extra ETH, the surplus is automatically refunded! </li> <li> <strong>User Activity:</strong> Each update is recorded so you can see how many pixels you’ve added or changed. This information is used to recognize the most active contributors. </li><li>You have to choose a community of your choice before interacting. There's no predefinite communities you can select, you can choose literally anything, and represent any communinty you wish.</li> </ul>

<h2>How to Interact with the Project</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Copy &amp; Paste Cell Data:</strong> When you click on a cell on the website, a pop-up displays its details in a simple format: <br /><code>["0","1","52","black"]</code> <br />This means board <strong>0</strong>, X coordinate <strong>1</strong>, Y coordinate <strong>52</strong>, and the cell’s color is <strong>black</strong>. You can copy this data to use when updating pixels via other interfaces. </li> <li> <strong>Update Multiple Pixels:</strong> The webpage provides an input field—for example, via a constructor on OKComputers pages—where you can paste a list of cell data in the above format to update many pixels at once using the <code>updatePixels</code> function. </li> <li> <strong>Via Etherscan:</strong> You can interact directly with the smart contract through Basescan “Write Contract” section. This allows you to update pixels and verify every transaction on the blockchain. </li> <li> <strong>Decentralized Webpage:</strong> The pixel board is displayed on a webpage stored directly on the blockchain (using OKComputers NFTs). This means the webpage is fully decentralized, and we love that. </li> <li>Note that you can check the cost of an update, be it for one or multiple pixels, using the “Read Contract” section and navigating to either getPixelCost or getPixelsCost where you can input your cell(s) data to know the price (Return value is in WEI, so you'll have to convert the value to ETH to pass it to the payable amount field on basescan.)</li><li>There's also this link (temp test) : https://okctest.surge.sh/</li></ul>

<h2>Community Rewards &amp; Event Details</h2> <p> The project is all about community! In addition to creating art, you have a chance to earn exciting rewards: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Prizes:</strong> There will be prizes for the top communities as well as the most active individual contributors. The system measures activity based on the total number of pixels placed and those still visible on the board. </li> <li> <strong>Event Duration:</strong> The event runs for 7 days. At the end of this period, each of the four boards will be minted as an NFT. Two NFTs will be awarded to the most active communities (which they can keep or give away), and two will go to the top individual contributors. </li> </ul>

<h2>Financial Fairness &amp; Maintenance</h2> <p> When you update a pixel, you pay a small fee in ETH. This fee increases each time the pixel is updated, but any excess ETH you send is automatically refunded. The collected ETH helps cover the maintenance cost of the project. Approximately 30% of any surplus funds will be directed to <strong>dailofrog</strong>—the developer behind OKComputers—as a thank-you for maintaining and improving the system, 30% will be used as <strong>prizes</strong> for the top scorer of the events and the rest shall be used at my own discretion</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2> <p> This project blends digital art and blockchain technology to create a decentralized, community-driven pixel board. Every pixel update is stored on the blockchain for complete transparency and fairness. You can interact with the project via a smart contract on Basescan or through any self made dapp made by you community to have an edge over others. Whether you’re simply enjoying the art, contributing by updating pixels, or competing for rewards, you’re a vital part of this global, collaborative art movement (and community war ?). </p>
