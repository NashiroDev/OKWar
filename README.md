  <h1>Decentralized Pixel Board Project</h1>

  <h2>What Is This Project?</h2>
  <p>
    Imagine a giant, digital canvas where anyone can help create a massive, collaborative artwork—one pixel at a time! This project is exactly that: a decentralized pixel board where thousands of users collectively “paint” a board made up of 68,000 tiny cells. And the best part? Everything is powered by blockchain technology, making it completely transparent and tamper-proof.
  </p>

  <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
  <p>
    There are four separate boards (numbered 0 through 3), and each board is a grid of 170 columns by 100 rows. Every cell (or pixel) on these boards can be updated by anyone.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Smart Contract:</strong> A special computer program running on the blockchain keeps track of every pixel. It records who owns each pixel, its color, and how many times it has been updated.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> The first time you update a pixel, it costs about 0.000022 ETH. Every subsequent update to that pixel becomes 15% more expensive. And don’t worry—if you send a little extra ETH, the excess is automatically refunded.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>User Activity:</strong> The system also tracks every user’s activity, so you can see how many pixels you’ve added or changed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Interact with the Project</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Using Etherscan:</strong> You can visit the project’s smart contract on Etherscan to see every pixel update in real time. The contract is fully verified and transparent, so you can even use the “Write Contract” tab to update a pixel.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Webpage:</strong> The pixel board is displayed on a decentralized webpage stored on the blockchain using OKComputers NFTs. This means the website is hosted in a way that no single entity controls it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pixel Editing:</strong> When you click on a pixel on the board, a small pop-up will show details in this format:
      <br>
      <code>["0","1","52","black"]</code>
      <br>
      This tells you:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"0"</strong> – which board (from 0 to 3)</li>
        <li><strong>"1"</strong> – the X coordinate (from 0 to 169)</li>
        <li><strong>"52"</strong> – the Y coordinate (from 0 to 99)</li>
        <li><strong>"black"</strong> – the chosen color (one of 16 options)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Community and Decentralization</h2>
  <p>
    This project isn’t just art—it’s a community. Every pixel update is stored on the blockchain, meaning all changes are transparent and cannot be altered by any single party. Users from around the world can see who is contributing the most and even form groups or communities around their art.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the entire system is built on decentralized technology:
    <br>- The smart contract keeps track of all edits.
    <br>- The website displaying the artwork is hosted on the blockchain using NFTs.
    <br>- There is no central server, ensuring that the project is resistant to censorship and downtime.
  </p>

  <h2>OKComputers NFT Integration</h2>
  <p>
    The project leverages OKComputers NFTs to publish the webpage (with the pixel board) directly on the blockchain. This means that:
    <br>- The webpage is stored and displayed in a trustless, decentralized way.
    <br>- The NFT not only acts as a digital collectible but also provides the link to the live board.
  </p>

  <h2>Financial Fairness</h2>
  <p>
    When updating a pixel, you pay a small fee in ETH. The fee increases each time the pixel is changed by 15%. However, if you send more ETH than needed for your update, the extra amount is automatically refunded. This ensures fairness and that you only pay precisely what’s required.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
  <p>
    You can participate by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Viewing and exploring the smart contract on Etherscan.</li>
    <li>Visiting the decentralized webpage to see the live board.</li>
    <li>Using the provided interface to update pixels, which then become part of the ever-evolving artwork.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>In Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This decentralized pixel board project is a unique blend of digital art, community collaboration, and blockchain technology. It gives the creative power back to the community by providing a transparent and fair way to create and share massive artwork. Whether you’re an art lover or just curious about blockchain technology, this project offers an engaging and truly decentralized experience.
