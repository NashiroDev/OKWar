<h2>What Is This Project?</h2> <p> Imagine a giant, digital canvas where anyone can help create a massive, collaborative artwork—one pixel at a time! This project is exactly that: a decentralized pixel board where thousands of users collectively “paint” a board made up of 68,000 tiny cells. And the best part? Everything is powered by blockchain technology, making it completely transparent and tamper-proof. </p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2> <p> There are four separate boards (numbered <strong>0</strong> through <strong>3</strong>), and each board is a grid of 170 columns by 100 rows. Every single cell on these boards can be updated by anyone. Here’s a quick breakdown: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Smart Contract:</strong> A special program running on the blockchain keeps track of every pixel. It records who owns each pixel, its color, and how many times it has been updated. </li> <li> <strong>Dynamic Pricing:</strong> The first time you update a pixel, it costs about <code>0.000022 ETH</code>. Every subsequent upgrade to that pixel becomes 15% more expensive. And if you send a little extra ETH, the surplus is automatically refunded! </li> <li> <strong>User Activity:</strong> Each update is recorded so you can see how many pixels you’ve added or changed. This data is used to recognize the most active contributors. </li> </ul>

<h2>How to Interact with the Project</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Via Etherscan:</strong> You can visit the smart contract on Etherscan to view every update. The contract is fully verified and transparent. Tech-savvy users can even call functions directly using Etherscan’s interface. </li> <li> <strong>Decentralized Webpage:</strong> The pixel board is displayed on a website that is stored directly on the blockchain through OKComputers NFTs. This means that the entire webpage is decentralized and cannot be taken down by any single entity. </li> <li> <strong>Pixel Editing:</strong> When you want to change a pixel, simply click on it. A pop-up will display the pixel’s details in a simple format such as: <br /><code>["0","1","52","black"]</code> <br /> Here: <ul> <li><strong>"0"</strong> – indicates the board (numbered from 0 to 3)</li> <li><strong>"1"</strong> – represents the X coordinate (ranging from 0 to 169)</li> <li><strong>"52"</strong> – represents the Y coordinate (ranging from 0 to 99)</li> <li><strong>"black"</strong> – is one of the 16 available colors</li> </ul> </li> </ul>


<h2>In Summary</h2> <p> This project combines digital art and blockchain technology to create a decentralized, community-driven pixel board. Every pixel update is recorded on the blockchain, the live artwork is fully decentralized, and smart contract mechanisms ensure fair pricing and automatic refunds. It’s an exciting way to be part of a global, collaborative art project that harnesses the power of blockchain! </p> <p> <em>Join us and make your mark on this revolutionary digital canvas!</em> </p> </body> </html>
